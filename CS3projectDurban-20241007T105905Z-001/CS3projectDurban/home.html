        <h1>To Efface The Stars</h1>
        <p> Light pollution has been affecting human and wildlife health since the industrial revolution.
            It also threatens astronomy as our view of the star is slowly fading. With this website, we will
            be tackling this issue and discuss proposed solutions aimed to resolve this problem, in relation 
            to the 'Life on Land' sustainable development goal (SDG).
